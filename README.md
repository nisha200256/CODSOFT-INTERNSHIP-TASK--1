📝 To‑Do List – Task 1
📌 Overview
The To‑Do List is a Python-based application that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently.
It allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed.
The program stores tasks in a file so they are saved even after closing the application.

✨ Features
Add Task – Add new tasks to your list.

View Tasks – See all your tasks with their completion status.

Mark Task as Completed – Update a task’s status to “Done”.

Delete Task – Remove a task from the list.

Persistent Storage – Saves tasks in a file (tasks.json) for future use.

User-Friendly Interface – Menu-driven commands for easy navigation.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3

JSON (for task storage)

OS module (for file handling)

🚀 How to Run
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

Save the program as todo_list.py (or use the .ipynb notebook version).

Run the script in your terminal or Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
python todo_list.py
or in Jupyter Notebook, run all cells.

📂 File Structure
bash
Copy code
todo_list.py / Untitled13 (1).ipynb   # Python or Notebook file
tasks.json                             # Automatically created to store tasks
README.md                              # Project documentation
📌 Example Menu

5. Exit
Enter your choice:
📝 Notes
The program automatically saves tasks to tasks.json.

If no tasks exist, the file will be created automatically.

All changes (add, complete, delete) are saved instantly.

If you want, I can also make a README that includes all your tasks (1–5) so you have one complete documentation for your whole project set.

Do you want me to make that?
